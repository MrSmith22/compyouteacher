export const MLK_ESSAY_PROMPT = `Write a compare and contrast essay explaining how Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. uses ethos, pathos, and logos in both "I Have a Dream" and "Letter from Birmingham Jail."

In your essay, you must:
• Compare how King uses rhetorical appeals in both texts
• Explain how those appeals connect to audience and purpose
• Support your ideas with specific evidence from both works

Your goal is not to summarize what King says, but to explain how and why he says it the way he does.`;
